# 🐼 RedPanda's CryptoTrading Adventure! 🚀

**(A tale of friendship, code, and meme coins)**

Hi! I'm Toma, a coder with a fluffy red panda friend who *loves* exploring the crypto markets, especially the wild world of pump.fun!  RedPanda's super curious and always sniffing out new tokens, but sometimes he needs a little help figuring out which ones are *really* worth chasing.  That's why I built this little app – it's like our own crypto treasure map!

This Python script is RedPanda's best friend (besides me, of course!). It helps us:

* **Sniff out new tokens:**  RedPanda's got a nose for fresh listings on pump.fun, but this script helps us find the *most promising* ones by checking things like how many people are holding them and their market cap. We only want the *good* stuff! ✨
* **Get the inside scoop:**  We use Gemini's smarts to analyze each token.  It's like having a wise old owl in our crypto crew! 🦉 It even tries to guess if a token is a "Fast Pump & Dump" (zoom zoom!), a "Long Hold" (for a cozy nap while it grows!), a "Small Profit Play" (a little snack!), or "Not Recommended" (yuck!).
* **Chat with our friends:**  We send all our findings to our Telegram channel so our crypto pals can join the adventure! 📢
* **Keep track of our progress:**  We record everything in a CSV file so we can learn from our past adventures and become even better crypto explorers! 🗺️
* **See what's trending:** RedPanda loves Twitter! We scan for trending hashtags and recent tweets about meme coins to get a feel for the market's vibe. 🐦
* **Check prices like pros:** We use Gate.io's API to track token prices and see if our predictions were right!  Did we find a gem or a dud?💎/💩

**How to Join the Adventure:**

1.  Clone this repo!
2.  Set up your environment variables (Gemini API key, Telegram bot token, Telegram channel ID, and Twitter Bearer Token).  Keep these secret! 🤫
3.  Run the script! `python your_script_name.py`

**Important Note:** RedPanda and I are just having fun! This script is *not* financial advice. Meme coins are super risky, so always do your own research and be careful with your crypto treasures!  💰

We hope you enjoy our little project!  Happy exploring! 🎉
